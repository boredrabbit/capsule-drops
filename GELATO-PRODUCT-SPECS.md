## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Design looks blurry in preview:**
- Make sure you uploaded the 3600×2400px version
- Don't use the small preview from the website

**Text too small to read:**
- The design is 12" wide, which is large for chest prints
- If text still looks small in sample, we can scale up to 13" or 14"

**Colors look washed out:**
- Switch to "Premium" quality level in Gelato
- Make sure your PNG has black as #1a1a1a or #000000

**Print positioning is off:**
- Double-check the "3.5 inches from collar" measurement
- Use Gelato's preview tool to visualize before ordering
